# GL Data Anomaly Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of the General Ledger (GL) data, comprising 556 accounts. Key findings highlight significant anomalies, particularly concerning the expected signs of account balances and the presence of statistical outliers. A total of 107 sign anomalies were identified across various account categories, with Current Liabilities showing the highest number of discrepancies (82 accounts). Additionally, 5 accounts were flagged for extreme Z-scores, indicating values significantly deviating from the mean. No missing data was found. These anomalies warrant immediate investigation to ensure data integrity and financial accuracy. Recommendations include a targeted review of the identified accounts and a reassessment of data entry and validation processes.

## Summary

This report details the findings from the processed GL data, focusing on total accounts, statistical metrics, and identified anomalies. It covers discrepancies in account balance signs, extreme Z-score outliers, and confirms the absence of null values. The analysis reveals that nearly 20% of the GL accounts have some form of anomaly, primarily related to incorrect signs for their respective account types.

*   **GL Accounts with Anomalous Z-Scores**:
    *   11316920: 3.3959437759932625
    *   12202000: 17.956130417518832
    *   12222000: -5.186198400471039
    *   34100800: -3.1782803448240413
    *   34100900: -12.667599499887453

Note: GL account 12222000 is present in both Sign Anomalies (Current Assets) and Z-Score Anomalies.

## Missing Data

No Null Values were found in the Amount field.

## Key Trends

*   **High Incidence of Sign Anomalies**: A substantial portion of GL accounts (19.24%) display incorrect signs, with Current Liabilities being the most affected category (82 accounts or 14.75% of total GL). This indicates a systemic issue in data entry, classification, or accounting rules for these accounts.
*   **Significant Outliers**: While fewer in number, the Z-score anomalies highlight a few accounts with extremely high or low values relative to the rest of the GL. The high standard deviation and variance further support the presence of significant dispersion and outliers in the dataset.
*   **Data Completeness**: The absence of null values in the amount field indicates good data completeness for transaction amounts.
*   **Balance Distribution**: The mean being close to zero while the median is a positive 125,444.0 suggests a heavily skewed distribution, likely with a large number of smaller positive balances and some very large values (both positive and negative) that average out to near zero.

## Recommendations

1.  **Investigate Sign Anomalies**: Conduct an immediate, detailed review of all 107 GL accounts identified with sign anomalies.
    *   Prioritize Current Liabilities accounts due to the high volume of discrepancies.
    *   Verify the correct classification of these accounts and the accuracy of their recorded balances.
    *   Review journal entries and source documents for these accounts.
2.  **Analyze Z-Score Outliers**: Investigate the 5 GL accounts with extreme Z-scores.
    *   Determine if these outliers are legitimate large transactions or errors.
    *   Assess the impact of these extreme values on overall financial reporting.
3.  **Review Accounting Policies and Data Entry Procedures**:
    *   Re-evaluate and potentially reinforce training for personnel involved in GL data entry to ensure adherence to accounting principles regarding account types and their expected signs.
    *   Implement automated checks or validation rules during data entry to prevent future sign anomalies.
4.  **Consider Further Statistical Analysis**: Given the high variance, consider segmenting the GL data by account type for more specific statistical analysis, as broad metrics may be heavily influenced by outliers.
