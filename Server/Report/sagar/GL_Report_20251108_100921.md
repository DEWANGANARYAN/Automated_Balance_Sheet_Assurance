# General Ledger Data Anomaly Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides an overview of the recent General Ledger (GL) data analysis, identifying key anomalies and statistical insights. The dataset comprises 556 GL accounts. While no missing values were found, indicating good data completeness, a significant number of sign anomalies and Z-score outliers were detected. Specifically, 107 accounts across various categories exhibit incorrect signs, with Current Liabilities accounting for the majority (82 anomalies). Several accounts also show extreme values as indicated by their Z-scores. These findings suggest potential data entry errors, misclassifications, or unusual transactions requiring immediate investigation to ensure financial data integrity.

## Summary

The analysis of the General Ledger data reveals several critical areas requiring attention. Out of 556 GL accounts, 107 (19.24%) displayed sign anomalies, most notably within Current Liabilities. Additionally, five accounts were identified as Z-score anomalies, indicating values significantly deviating from the mean. The absence of null values is a positive indicator of data completeness. The detected anomalies point to potential data quality issues that could impact financial reporting accuracy.

## Missing Data

No null values were found in the Amount field, indicating a complete dataset regarding this specific attribute.

## Key Trends

1.  **High Volume of Sign Anomalies:** A substantial number of GL accounts (107 total, 19.24%) exhibit incorrect signs, particularly concentrated within Current Liabilities (82 accounts). This suggests a systemic issue, potentially in data entry, ledger mapping, or accounting policy application.
2.  **Significant Outliers:** The presence of five Z-score anomalies with very high absolute values (e.g., 17.96 for 12202000) indicates the existence of extremely large or small amounts compared to the dataset's average. These could represent significant transactions, errors, or unique financial events.
3.  **Data Completeness:** The absence of null values in the 'Amount' field is a positive trend, ensuring that all records have a recorded value.

## Recommendations

1.  **Investigate Sign Anomalies:** Prioritize the investigation of all 107 GL accounts listed under 'Sign Anomalies'. Focus initially on Current Liabilities due to the high volume of discrepancies.
    *   Verify the accuracy of entries.
    *   Review GL account configurations and expected natural balances.
    *   Assess if there are specific business processes or system settings contributing to these incorrect signs.
2.  **Examine Z-Score Anomalies:** Conduct a detailed review of the five GL accounts identified as Z-score outliers.
    *   Determine the nature of these extreme values (e.g., large transactions, consolidations, data errors).
    *   Confirm their validity and proper accounting treatment.
3.  **Implement Data Validation Rules:** Introduce automated data validation checks at the point of entry or during batch processing to flag and prevent sign anomalies and potentially unusual magnitudes of transactions.
4.  **Review Accounting Policies:** Ensure clear and consistent application of accounting policies, especially concerning account classification and the expected debit/credit nature of specific GL ranges.
5.  **Ongoing Monitoring:** Establish continuous monitoring for similar anomalies to proactively identify and address data quality issues.
