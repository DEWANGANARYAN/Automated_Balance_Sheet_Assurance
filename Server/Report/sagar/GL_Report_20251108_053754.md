# GL Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the analysis of 556 General Ledger (GL) accounts, identifying data quality issues related to sign conventions, statistical anomalies, and missing data. A significant number of accounts across Current Liabilities (82 accounts) and Current Assets (20 accounts) show incorrect signs. Z-score analysis highlighted 5 accounts as statistical outliers. While no missing values were found, the identified anomalies suggest a need for thorough data validation and reconciliation to ensure financial accuracy. Addressing these issues is crucial for reliable financial reporting and decision-making.

## Summary

This report details the findings from a recent analysis of General Ledger data. The objective was to identify common data integrity issues such as incorrect sign conventions, statistical outliers, and missing data points. The analysis covered a total of 556 GL accounts. Key findings include a substantial number of sign anomalies in Current Liabilities and Current Assets, as well as several Z-score outliers. No missing data was detected in the 'Amount' field. These findings underscore potential data quality challenges that require attention.

## Z-Score Anomalies

The Z-score analysis identified accounts with values significantly deviating from the mean, indicating potential outliers. A Z-score greater than the critical range suggests an anomaly.
*   **11316920**: 3.3959437759932625
*   **12202000**: 17.956130417518832
*   **12222000**: -5.186198400471039
*   **34100800**: -3.1782803448240413
*   **34100900**: -12.667599499887453

There are **5** accounts identified as Z-score anomalies (0.9% of total GL accounts).

## Missing Data

No null values were found in the 'Amount' field across the entire GL dataset.

## Key Trends

*   **Prevalence of Sign Anomalies**: The most significant issue identified is the high number of sign anomalies, particularly within Current Liabilities (82 accounts) and Current Assets (20 accounts). This indicates a systemic issue in how transactions are recorded or classified for these account types.
*   **Outliers Detected**: A small but significant number of accounts (5) were identified as statistical outliers via Z-score analysis, suggesting these values are exceptionally high or low compared to the rest of the dataset and warrant further investigation for data entry errors or unusual financial events.
*   **Data Completeness**: The absence of null values in the 'Amount' field is a positive indicator of data completeness for this critical field.

## Recommendations

1.  **Investigate Sign Anomalies**: Prioritize a thorough investigation into the 107 accounts with sign anomalies. This includes reviewing transaction details, journal entries, and the underlying accounting logic for each account to determine the root cause of the incorrect signs.
2.  **Implement Data Validation Rules**: Establish and enforce automated data validation rules at the point of data entry or system integration to prevent incorrect signs from occurring in the future, especially for Current Assets and Current Liabilities.
3.  **Review Z-Score Outliers**: Examine the 5 accounts identified by Z-score analysis. Understand the nature of these large deviations. While some may be legitimate, they could also flag significant errors or unusual activity requiring further scrutiny.
4.  **Regular Data Quality Audits**: Implement a routine data quality audit process to continuously monitor GL data for similar anomalies, ensuring ongoing accuracy and compliance.
5.  **Training and Awareness**: Provide training to accounting and data entry personnel on proper GL account classification and sign conventions to minimize manual errors.
