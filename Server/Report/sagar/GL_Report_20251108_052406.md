## Z-Score Anomalies

The following GL accounts have amounts with Z-scores exceeding the critical range, indicating they are statistical outliers.

*   **11316920:** 3.3959437759932625
*   **12202000:** 17.956130417518832
*   **12222000:** -5.186198400471039
*   **34100800:** -3.1782803448240413
*   **34100900:** -12.667599499887453

## Missing Data

*   **Null Values in Amount:** No Null Values found in Amount

## Key Trends

*   **Prevalence of Sign Anomalies:** A significant trend is the high number of accounts with incorrect signs. Current Liabilities show the highest number of anomalies (82 accounts), followed by Current Assets (20 accounts). This indicates a systemic issue in recording transactions or misclassification within these balance sheet categories.
*   **Outliers in Financial Data:** The presence of Z-score anomalies suggests that certain GL account balances are significantly different from the average, pointing to potentially large transactions or unusual balances that warrant further investigation.
*   **Data Completeness:** The absence of null values in the 'Amount' field is a positive indicator of data completeness for this specific attribute.

## Recommendations

1.  **Investigate Sign Anomalies:** Prioritize immediate investigation into all GL accounts flagged for incorrect signs, especially the 82 Current Liability accounts. This could stem from incorrect journal entries, misapplication of accounting principles (e.g., debit/credit reversal), or incorrect account type configuration.
2.  **Review Z-Score Outliers:** Conduct a thorough review of the five GL accounts identified with high Z-scores. Understand the underlying transactions or balances driving these extreme values to determine if they are legitimate or errors.
3.  **Implement Data Validation Rules:** Introduce automated data validation checks at the point of data entry or during batch processing to flag sign convention violations in real-time, preventing future anomalies.
4.  **Review Chart of Accounts:** Verify the definitions and expected behaviors (e.g., normal debit/credit balance) of account types, particularly for Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Equity, Income, and Expenses, to ensure they align with the business's accounting policies.
5.  **Training and Awareness:** Provide training to personnel responsible for GL entries on proper accounting conventions and the importance of accurate data entry to minimize sign errors.
